    <div class="sticky">
      <h1>Sticky:</h1>
      <p>Sticky Position: sticks on the page if u scroll up or down it will stay on the page wherever u go it will stick</p>
    </div>
	<div class="static">
    	<h1>Static:</h1>
		<p>Static Position: is the default value. An element with position static is not positioned in any special way. A static element is said to be not positioned and an element with its position set to anything else is said to be positioned.</p>
  </div> 
    <div class="relative">
    	<h1>Relative:</h1>
    	<p>Relative Position: behaves the same as static unless you add some extra properties also it sticks to the before and after element and you can also put in it absolute position mode.</p>
    	<p>Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.</p>
    	<div class="absolute">
	 	<h1>Absolute:</h1>
	 	<p>Absolute Position: can be put wherever you want over elements or sideways or top bottom above everywhere u desire, absolute becomes static if there was none elements with position before it, unless there was an element positioned before it the element is positioned absolutely to its first positioned parent.</p>
    </div>
